### Hi there 👋
I've developed and launched many successful SaaS products in diverse sectors like healthcare, agriculture, tourism, and education, generating millions in revenue. I leverage Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) and open-source tools to build high-performing teams and deliver innovative solutions. I've helped companies to scale systems to support millions of users. I'm passionate about creating user-centric solutions that make a real impact and contribute to positive change.
